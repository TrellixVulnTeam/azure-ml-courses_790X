# Course Syllabus

This course will help you gain the skills that enable you to create large-scale data ingestion solutions in the cloud.

## Module 1. Integrate data with Azure Data Factory or Azure Synapse Pipeline

When you need to trigger a batch movement of data, or to set up a regular schedule  Azure Data Factory (ADF) is the service that can be used.
After completing this module, you will be able to:

1) Understand Azure Data Factory and
2) Set up and manage Azure Data Factory and overview its core components.
3) Create Linked Services
4) Create Datasets
5) Create Activities and Pipelines
6) Manage Integration runtimes

## Module 2. Petabyte-scale ingestion with Azure Data Factory or Azure Synapse Pipeline

In the first stage of data integration source data is ingested from any number of systems into a destination or an intermediary data store. Azure Data Factory provides differing ingestion methods that can connect to nearly a hundred different data connectors. After completing this module, you will be able to: 

1) Describe the data ingestion methods
2) Understand the connectors that are available
3) Use the Copy Activity
4) Manage a self-hosted integration runtime
5) Set up the Azure integration runtime
6) Describe data ingestion security considerations.

## Module 3. Perform code-free transformation at scale with Azure Data Factory or Azure Synapse Pipeline

Azure Data Factory has a range of tools that can transform and cleanse data to particular business requirements. After completing this module, you will be able to:

1) Explain transformation methods
2) Perform common data transformation and cleansing activities within Azure Data Factory without using code and
3) Implement Slowly Changing Dimension using Azure Data Factory or Azure Synapse Pipelines.

## Module 4. Orchestrate data movement and transformation in Azure Data Factory or Azure Synapse Pipeline

Control flow is an orchestration of pipeline activities that includes chaining activities in a sequence, branching, defining parameters at the pipeline level, and passing arguments while invoking the pipeline on demand or from a trigger. After completing this module, you will be able to:

1) Use Azure Data Factory to orchestrate large-scale data movement by using other Azure Data Platform and Machine Learning technologies.
2) Understand the data factory control flow
3) Work with data factory pipelines
4) Debug data factory pipelines
5) Add parameters to data factory components and
6) Execute data factory packages.

## Module 5. Execute existing SSIS packages in Azure Data Factory or Azure Synapse Pipeline

Azure Data Factory provides the capability to lift and shift  SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) solutions to the cloud. After completing this module, you will be able to:

1) Integrate SQL Server Integration Services packages into an Azure Data Factory solution.

## Module 6. Operationalize your Azure Data Factory or Azure Synapse Pipeline

Azure Data Factory integrates with Azure DevOps and GitHub to allow easy source control and effective continuous integration and delivery. After completing this module, you will be able to:

1) Publish your Azure Data Factory work between different environments.
2) Configure a git repository with a development factory
3) Create and merge a feature branch
4) Deploy a release pipeline
5) Visually monitor pipeline runs
6) Integrate with Azure Monitor
7) Set up alerts
8) Rerun pipeline runs and
9) Learn about Azure Data Factory security

## Module 7. Receive data with Azure Data Share and transforming with Azure Data Factory

Azure Data Factory integrates with Azure DevOps and GitHub to allow easy source control and effective continuous integration and delivery. After completing this module, you will be able to:

1) Ingest data from Azure Data Share into Azure Data Factory pipelines to build automated ingestion pipelines.
2) Receive data using Azure Data Share
3) Ingest data into Azure Data Lake Gen 2 using Azure Data Factory and
4) Join and transform shared and owned data.

## Module 8. Course Practice Exam

In this module, you will take a practice exam that covers key skills measured in the Exam DP-203: Data Engineering on Microsoft Azure  on Data integration at scale with Azure Data Factory or Azure Synapse Pipeline.  After completing this module, you will be able to:

1) Prepare for the Microsoft Certified: Azure Data Engineer Associate exam.
