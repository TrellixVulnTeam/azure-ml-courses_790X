# Explain machine learning models with Azure Machine Learning

## Creating explanations

When you use an estimator or a script to train a model in an Azure Machine Learning experiment, you can create an explainer and upload the explanation it generates to the run for later analysis.

### Creating an explanation in the experiment script

To create an explanation in the experiment script, you'll need to ensure that the **azureml-interpret** and **azureml-contrib-interpret** packages are installed in the run environment. Then you can use these to create an explanation from your trained model and upload it to the run outputs.

The following code example shows how code to generate and upload a model explanation can be incorporated into an experiment script.

```python
# Import Azure ML run library
from azureml.core.run import Run
from azureml.contrib.interpret.explanation.explanation_client import ExplanationClient
from interpret.ext.blackbox import TabularExplainer
# other imports as required

# Get the experiment run context
run = Run.get_context()

# code to train model goes here

# Get explanation
explainer = TabularExplainer(model, X_train, features=features, classes=labels)
explanation = explainer.explain_global(X_test)

# Get an Explanation Client and upload the explanation
explain_client = ExplanationClient.from_run(run)
explain_client.upload_model_explanation(explanation, comment='Tabular Explanation')

# Complete the run
run.complete()
```

### Viewing the explanation

You can view the explanation you created for your model in the **Explanations** tab for the run in Azure Machine learning studio.

You can also use the **ExplanationClient** object to download the explanation in Python.

```python
from azureml.contrib.interpret.explanation.explanation_client import ExplanationClient

client = ExplanationClient.from_run_id(workspace=ws,
                                       experiment_name=experiment.experiment_name, 
                                       run_id=run.id)
explanation = client.download_model_explanation()
feature_importances = explanation.get_feature_importance_dict()
```
