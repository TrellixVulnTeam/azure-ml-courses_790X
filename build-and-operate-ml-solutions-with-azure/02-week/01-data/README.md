# Work with Data in Azure Machine Learning

## Introduction to datasets

Datasets are versioned packaged data objects that can be easily consumed in experiments and pipelines. Datasets are the recommended way to work with data, and are the primary mechanism for advanced Azure Machine Learning capabilities like data labeling and data drift monitoring.

### Types of dataset

Datasets are typically based on files in a datastore, though they can also be based on URLs and other sources. You can create the following types of dataset:

+ **Tabular:** The data is read from the dataset as a table. You should use this type of dataset when your data is consistently structured and you want to work with it in common tabular data structures, such as Pandas dataframes.
+ **File:** The dataset presents a list of file paths that can be read as though from the file system. Use this type of dataset when your data is unstructured, or when you need to process the data at the file level (for example, to train a convolutional neural network from a set of image files).

### Creating and registering datasets

You can use the visual interface in Azure Machine Learning studio or the Azure Machine Learning SDK to create datasets from individual files or multiple file paths. The paths can include wildcards (for example, /files/*.csv) making it possible to encapsulate data from a large number of files in a single dataset.

After you've created a dataset, you can register it in the workspace to make it available for use in experiments and data processing pipelines later.

### Creating and registering tabular datasets

To create a tabular dataset using the SDK, use the from_delimited_files method of the Dataset.Tabular class, like this:

```python
from azureml.core import Dataset

blob_ds = ws.get_default_datastore()
csv_paths = [(blob_ds, 'data/files/current_data.csv'),
             (blob_ds, 'data/files/archive/*.csv')]
tab_ds = Dataset.Tabular.from_delimited_files(path=csv_paths)
tab_ds = tab_ds.register(workspace=ws, name='csv_table')
```

The dataset in this example includes data from two file paths within the default datastore:

+ The **current_data.csv** file in the **data/files** folder.
+ All .csv files in the **data/files/archive/** folder.
After creating the dataset, the code registers it in the workspace with the name **csv_table**.

### Creating and registering file datasets

To create a file dataset using the SDK, use the **from_files** method of the **Dataset.File** class, like this:

```python
from azureml.core import Dataset

blob_ds = ws.get_default_datastore()
file_ds = Dataset.File.from_files(path=(blob_ds, 'data/files/images/*.jpg'))
file_ds = file_ds.register(workspace=ws, name='img_files')
```

The dataset in this example includes all .jpg files in the **data/files/images** path within the default datastore:
After creating the dataset, the code registers it in the workspace with the name **img_files**.

### Retrieving a registered dataset

After registering a dataset, you can retrieve it by using any of the following techniques:

+ The **datasets** dictionary attribute of a **Workspace** object.
+ The **get_by_name** or **get_by_id** method of the **Dataset** class.

Both of these techniques are shown in the following code:

```python
import azureml.core
from azureml.core import Workspace, Dataset

# Load the workspace from the saved config file
ws = Workspace.from_config()

# Get a dataset from the workspace datasets collection
ds1 = ws.datasets['csv_table']

# Get a dataset by name from the datasets class
ds2 = Dataset.get_by_name(ws, 'img_files')
```

### Dataset versioning

Datasets can be versioned, enabling you to track historical versions of datasets that were used in experiments, and reproduce those experiments with data in the same state.

You can create a new version of a dataset by registering it with the same name as a previously registered dataset and specifying the **create_new_version** property:

```python
img_paths = [(blob_ds, 'data/files/images/*.jpg'),
             (blob_ds, 'data/files/images/*.png')]
file_ds = Dataset.File.from_files(path=img_paths)
file_ds = file_ds.register(workspace=ws, name='img_files', create_new_version=True)
```

In this example, the .png files in the **images** folder have been added to the definition of the **img_paths** dataset example used in the previous topic.

### Retrieving a specific dataset version

You can retrieve a specific version of a dataset by specifying the **version** parameter in the **get_by_name** method of the **Dataset** class.

```python
img_ds = Dataset.get_by_name(workspace=ws, name='img_files', version=2)
```

## Use datasets

Datasets are the primary way to pass data to experiments that train models.

### Work with tabular datasets

You can read data directly from a tabular dataset by converting it into a Pandas or Spark dataframe:

```python
df = tab_ds.to_pandas_dataframe()
# code to work with dataframe goes here, for example:
print(df.head())
```

### Pass a tabular dataset to an experiment script

When you need to access a dataset in an experiment script, you must pass the dataset to the script. There are two ways you can do this.

### Use a script argument for a tabular dataset

You can pass a tabular dataset as a script argument. When you take this approach, the argument received by the script is the unique ID for the dataset in your workspace. In the script, you can then get the workspace from the run context and use it to retrieve the dataset by it's ID.

+ _ScriptRunConfig:_

```python
env = Environment('my_env')
packages = CondaDependencies.create(conda_packages=['pip'],
                                    pip_packages=['azureml-defaults',
                                                  'azureml-dataprep[pandas]'])
env.python.conda_dependencies = packages

script_config = ScriptRunConfig(source_directory='my_dir',
                                script='script.py',
                                arguments=['--ds', tab_ds],
                                environment=env)
```

+ _Script:_

```python
from azureml.core import Run, Dataset

parser.add_argument('--ds', type=str, dest='dataset_id')
args = parser.parse_args()

run = Run.get_context()
ws = run.experiment.workspace
dataset = Dataset.get_by_id(ws, id=args.dataset_id)
data = dataset.to_pandas_dataframe()
```

### Use a named input for a tabular dataset

Alternatively, you can pass a tabular dataset as a named input. In this approach, you use the **as_named_input** method of the dataset to specify a name for the dataset.

Then in the script, you can retrieve the dataset by name from the run context's **input_datasets** collection without needing to retrieve it from the workspace. Note that if you use this approach, you still need to include a script argument for the dataset, even though you donâ€™t actually use it to retrieve the dataset.

+ _ScriptRunConfig:_

```python
env = Environment('my_env')
packages = CondaDependencies.create(conda_packages=['pip'],
                                    pip_packages=['azureml-defaults',
                                                  'azureml-dataprep[pandas]'])
env.python.conda_dependencies = packages

script_config = ScriptRunConfig(source_directory='my_dir',
                                script='script.py',
                                arguments=['--ds', tab_ds.as_named_input('my_dataset')],
                                environment=env)
```

+ _Script:_

```python
from azureml.core import Run

parser.add_argument('--ds', type=str, dest='ds_id')
args = parser.parse_args()

run = Run.get_context()
dataset = run.input_datasets['my_dataset']
data = dataset.to_pandas_dataframe()
```

### Work with file datasets

When working with a file dataset, you can use the to_path() method to return a list of the file paths encapsulated by the dataset:

```python
for file_path in file_ds.to_path():
    print(file_path)
```

### Pass a file dataset to an experiment script

Just as with a Tabular dataset, there are two ways you can pass a file dataset to a script. However, there are some key differences in the way that the dataset is passed.

### Use a script argument for a file dataset

You can pass a file dataset as a script argument. Unlike with a tabular dataset, you must specify a mode for the file dataset argument, which can be **as_download** or **as_mount**. This provides an access point that the script can use to read the files in the dataset. 

In most cases, you should use **as_download**, which copies the files to a temporary location on the compute where the script is being run. However, if you are working with a large amount of data for which there may not be enough storage space on the experiment compute, use **as_mount** to stream the files directly from their source.

+ _ScriptRunConfig:_

```python
env = Environment('my_env')
packages = CondaDependencies.create(conda_packages=['pip'],
                                    pip_packages=['azureml-defaults',
                                                  'azureml-dataprep[pandas]'])
env.python.conda_dependencies = packages

script_config = ScriptRunConfig(source_directory='my_dir',
                                script='script.py',
                                arguments=['--ds', file_ds.as_download()],
                                environment=env)
```

+ _Script:_

```python
from azureml.core import Run
import glob

parser.add_argument('--ds', type=str, dest='ds_ref')
args = parser.parse_args()
run = Run.get_context()

imgs = glob.glob(args.ds_ref + "/*.jpg")
```

### Use a named input for a file dataset

You can also pass a file dataset as a named input. In this approach, you use the **as_named_input** method of the dataset to specify a name before specifying the access mode. Then in the script, you can retrieve the dataset by name from the run context's **input_datasets** collection and read the files from there. 

As with tabular datasets, if you use a named input, you still need to include a script argument for the dataset, even though you donâ€™t actually use it to retrieve the dataset.

+ _ScriptRunConfig:_

```python
env = Environment('my_env')
packages = CondaDependencies.create(conda_packages=['pip'],
                                    pip_packages=['azureml-defaults',
                                                  'azureml-dataprep[pandas]'])
env.python.conda_dependencies = packages

script_config = ScriptRunConfig(source_directory='my_dir',
                                script='script.py',
                                arguments=['--ds', file_ds.as_named_input('my_ds').as_download()],
                                environment=env)
```

+ _Script:

```python
from azureml.core import Run
import glob

parser.add_argument('--ds', type=str, dest='ds_ref')
args = parser.parse_args()
run = Run.get_context()

dataset = run.input_datasets['my_ds']
imgs= glob.glob(dataset + "/*.jpg")
```
